# Noob Calculus

## Release/Version Info
The current release is **release 1**, which is considered _stable_.

## Summary
This application demonstrates the following statement:

$$ 1=\displaystyle\sum^\infty_{x=1}+\frac1{2^x}=\frac1{2}+\frac1{4}+\frac1{8}+\frac1{16}+\ldots $$

In calculus, this is a sum of a geometric series:

$$ \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac12 \times \frac{1-(\frac12)^n}{1-(\frac12)}=\frac{1-0}{2\times\frac12}=1 $$
